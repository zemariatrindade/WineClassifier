How to run the model?

1. In your local directory you need to have the best_model.pkl file
2. Once in your local directory inside the terminal run: python3 ingestion.py test_wine_dataset2.csv

The path_to_file should be the path to the csv you want to run the model on and create the db.
In my case is test_wine_dataset2.csv.
